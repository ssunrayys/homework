1. Create an array arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] and use it to display the string 'a+b, c+d'.

2. Create an array arr with elements 2, 5, 3, 9. Multiply the first element of the array by the second and the third element by the fourth. Add the results, assign the variable result. Display the value of this variable

3. Given an array [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7,8,9] ]. Print the number 4 from this array to the screen.

4. Given an object {js:['jQuery', 'Angular'], php: 'hello', css: 'world'}. Output the word 'jQuery' with it.

5. Fill in the array as follows: write 'x' in the first element, 'xx' in the second, 'xxx' in the third, and so on.

6. Fill the array as follows: write '1' in the first element, '22' in the second, '333' in the third, and so on.

7. Make an arrayFill function that will fill the array with the given values. The first parameter the function takes is the value to fill the array with, and the second parameter is how many elements should be in the array. Example: arrayFill('x', 5) will make an array ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'].

8. An array with numbers is given. Find out how many elements from the beginning of the array must be added to make the total more than 10.

9. An array with numbers is given. Without using the reverse method, reverse its elements in reverse order.

10. Given a two-dimensional array with numbers, for example [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]. Find the sum of the elements of this array. The array, of course, can be arbitrary.

11. Given a three-dimensional array with numbers, for example [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]. Find the sum of the elements of this array. The array, of course, can be arbitrary.
