You need to write a function that:

:point_right: called fib <br>
:point_right: Takes only 1 argument (n) <br>
:point_right: Default argument value = 1 <br>
:point_right: returns the n-th element from the sequence of Fibonacci numbers as a result of execution <br>
:point_right: The task has several solutions, you can not bother, do as you think is right
