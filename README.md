You are preparing borscht and you need to calculate how many kilograms you need to buy potatoes.

For 1 liter of borscht, 4 potatoes are needed, the average weight of one potato is 75 grams.

How many kilos of potatoes do you need to buy to make 48 liters of borscht?

Weight of one potato (gr.) = 75

The number of liters of borscht (l.) = 48



Use the weight information to calculate the cost of potatoes in the store, if after calculating the weight you get a float number, then round it up and bring it to an integer.

The price of 1kg of potatoes (UAH) = 13

You need to write a function that will calculate the cost of buying the right amount of potatoes.
