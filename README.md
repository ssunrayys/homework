I need to create a function that will raise a number to a power

Asking the user for a number (using prompt)
We ask the user the power to which this number needs to be raised (using prompt)
Create a function that takes 2 arguments (number, degree)
Set the argument that takes the degree to the default value of 1
Inside the function, you need to write a check if the arguments are not numbers, terminate the function with an indication that the user entered incorrect data, for example (return 'some error')
If the check was successful, then raise the number to a power (we work with function arguments)
Return the result of the function and terminate it
Write the result of the function call to a variable and display it to the user via alert()
