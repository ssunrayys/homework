Steps: When loading the page, show the user a window in which to ask his year of birth. When he enters it and presses OK, ask him what city he lives in. If successful, show him another window where to ask his favorite sport. When you click on OK, we show him a window where the following information should be displayed: His age. If the user enters Kyiv, Moscow or Minsk, then show him a message - “You live in the capital ...” and substitute the dots for the country whose capital he entered. Otherwise, we show him “you live in a city ...” and instead of dots - the entered city. We choose three sports and three champions in these sports. Accordingly, if the user enters one of these sports, then we show him the message “Cool! Do you want to become ...” and substitute the name and surname of the champion in place of the dots. All this should be displayed in one window. If in some of the cases he does not want to enter information and presses Cancel, show him a message - “It is a pity that you did not want to enter your (s) ...” and indicate that he did not want to enter - date of birth, city or sport .
