Your function should repeat the basic functionality of the flat method, but with some modifications.



The function takes only 1 argument - an array,

The function returns only a one-dimensional array.

If the user passes more than 1 argument, throw an error to the console.



throw new Error('Function accepts only 1 argument, too many arguments provided');



If a multidimensional array was passed to the function, then it should return a new one-dimensional array.



If a one-dimensional array was passed to the function, then it must return a new array that is a complete copy of the passed.
