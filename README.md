Task #1

Implement a recursive function that finds the factorial of the number passed to it

getFactorial(3) // should return the factorial of 3 in this case! = 3 * 2 * 1



Task #2

Implement a recursive function that finds and raises a number to a power.

The number to be raised to a power is passed as the first argument to the function.

The degree is passed as the second argument to the function

pow(num, degree)



Task #3

Recursive summation

Challenge: Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of given positive integers a and b without directly using the + operator.



It is necessary to increment one number by one until the other number is equal to zero.
