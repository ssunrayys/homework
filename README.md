Ask the user for 2 numbers (number, degree) and then display the result in a pop-up window

mainFunction

1. We write a function that takes a callback as a parameter.

2. In the body of the function, you need to write code that will ask the user for 2 numbers - these numbers must be stored in different variables.

3. Also in the body of the function, you need to call the callback that you pass as an argument.

4. When calling callback, you need to pass in arguments those 2 numbers that you requested from the user earlier.

callback exponentiation function

This function will be passed to mainFunction as an argument

1. The function must take 2 parameters: those numbers that we pass to it in the main function in paragraph 4 of the “Main Function”.

2. In the body of the function, we need to raise the number to a power and write the result of this operation to a variable.

3. Also in the body of the function, you need to write code that will display the result to the user in a pop-up window.

—————

After writing these functions, you need to call the “Main Function” and pass the callback function as an argument (by name - without calling)
