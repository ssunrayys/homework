Let's work with a numerical palindrome

A numeric palindrome is a natural number that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. In other words, it differs in the symmetry of the record (the arrangement of numbers), and the number of characters can be either even or odd.



A palindrome can be obtained as a result of operations on other numbers. Take any natural number and add it to the reversed number, that is, written in the same digits, but in reverse order. Let's do the same action with the resulting sum and repeat it until a palindrome is formed. Sometimes just one step is enough (for example, 312 + 213 = 525), but usually at least two are required. Let's say the number 96 generates palindrome 4884 only at the fourth step....
